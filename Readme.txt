# Polymer Property Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses Python and basic machine learning techniques to predict selected polymer properties based on input parameters.  
An interactive web application is built using Streamlit for real-time prediction.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature handling
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Streamlit-based web interface for user input and prediction

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
